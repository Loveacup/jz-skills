# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [17.2.10] - 2026-08-06

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced the re-exported `zod` API with an `omptype`-backed compatibility facade (`@oh-my-pi/omptype/zod`). Plugins retain the standard Zod-style builder interface, but real Zod-specific APIs are no longer available.

### Added

- Added a `--trusted-extension <absolute-path>` CLI flag to load an exact extension-module allowlist, bypassing ambient extension discovery.
- Added resumable session details to fatal crash outputs, including a suggested `omp --resume <session-id>` command to quickly resume persisted live agent sessions.

### Changed

- Reworked the Ctrl+S Agent Hub into a responsive fullscreen roster and selected-agent inspector, featuring aggregate status/usage metrics, detailed per-agent views (task, model, activity, usage, lineage), roster and spawn-tree views, stable ordering, asynchronous persisted-session discovery, restored historical metadata, and improved keyboard and mouse navigation.
- Replaced `arktype` with `@oh-my-pi/omptype` for all tool parameter and configuration schemas, resulting in significantly faster startup times. Configuration schema errors are now reported via `OmpErrors` entries using the standard `path`/`problem` format.

### Fixed

- Fixed panel commands (such as `/usage` and `/advisor status`) appearing unresponsive during active turns by flushing the deferred-panel queue at every settle, terminal or not. The deferral itself stays silent: mounting a status line into the transcript mid-turn re-renders rows below the live block and duplicates them in native scrollback (issues #4806/#6767).
- Fixed the bundled `ts-no-tiny-functions` rule failing to match one-line arrow functions in files with trailing newlines.
- Fixed advisor refusals skipping the model fallback chain, and bounded refusal recovery to a single attempt per model to prevent infinite fallback loops.
- Fixed repeated `/mcp reauth` commands getting stuck by ensuring new reauthorization requests cancel and clean up any pending MCP OAuth login flows.
- Fixed WSL host-home resolution to build `/mnt/<drive>/...` fallback paths using POSIX semantics regardless of the host platform.
- Fixed Python evaluation shell helpers (`!cmd`, `%%bash`, `%pip`) letting child processes inherit the runner's stdin, which previously caused deadlocks on Windows. Additionally, `%%bash` now correctly resolves Git Bash on Windows.
- Fixed subagents spawned via model-role aliases incorrectly falling back to the `default` role's retry chain instead of their own configured role chain.
- Fixed Linux/X11 clipboard reads failing when `xclip` is missing but `xsel` is available.
- Hardened Linux Chromium executable detection to filter out non-executable files, invalid wrappers, and candidates that hang during version probes.
- Fixed Bash command preview crashes caused by malformed tool arguments containing non-string environment values.
- Fixed UI rendering in the model browser and model hub where `nerd`-preset role chips would overlap and obscure the first character of labels.
- Fixed Codex web search sending incompatible request shapes to certain models, which caused the hosted `web_search` tool to ignore them.
- Fixed resumed or rebuilt sessions incorrectly applying stale rewind reports from previous checkpoint cycles to new checkpoints.
- Fixed the `read` tool incorrectly parsing semicolon-delimited internal URLs (such as batched `skill://` resources) as a single invalid resource.
- Fixed `pi.getAllTools()` returning bare strings instead of `ToolInfo[]` objects, restoring compatibility with extensions built against the upstream contract.
- Fixed legacy extensions failing to load in compiled binaries when resolving bundled dependencies via dynamic `createRequire` factories.
- Fixed Wayland window activation and native input handling by correctly reporting them as unavailable rather than attempting unsupported foreground-delivery paths.
- Fixed live execution progress being hidden in the conversation view after approving a plan in the fullscreen Plan Review.
- Fixed `omp -r` failing to discover sessions created under the temporary hashed project-directory scheme by adding a one-way migration back to legacy path-based names.
- Prevented the `read` tool from advertising or resolving `memory://` URIs when the memory backend is disabled.
- Fixed the Shift-Tab thinking mode UI rendering the `off` state as a blank label, which made it appear that reasoning could not be disabled.
- Fixed parsing of POSIX `$EDITOR` commands that contain quoted arguments or executable paths with spaces.
- Fixed persisted Agent Hub rows losing the explicit caller model role when a subagent used a model override, preserving role provenance across restarts.
- Fixed unobserved promise rejections in browser helpers (such as `tab.waitForResponse()`) causing tab workers to hang or crash.

## [17.2.9] - 2026-08-05

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed `compareVersions` to `compareChangelogEntries` in `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent/utils/changelog`. The function signature and behavior are unchanged; update imports to use the new name.

### Added

- Added automatic detection of common Ungoogled Chromium Linux installations for the browser tool.

### Changed

- Restored the legacy project-scoped session directory naming scheme and removed its automatic migration ([#7646](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7646)).
- Routed Bun install-cache pruning in `update-cli` through the shared `compareVersions` utility (`@oh-my-pi/pi-utils`), removing a duplicate local comparator that rounded large numeric version identifiers via `Number`.

### Fixed

- Retried concurrent-request caps with a short backoff without deleting valid Copilot credentials or rotating through sibling accounts.
- Fixed the default `textVerbosity` setting being forwarded to OpenAI Codex requests unless the user explicitly configures it, preserving Codex's native response-control defaults. ([#4949](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/4949))
- Reduced streaming CPU usage by coalescing the cumulative `message_update` deltas of a turn at the event-controller dispatch boundary: at most one streaming-state rebuild runs per ~33ms window instead of one per token, cutting the per-token handler work that dominated the CPU profile of streaming sessions (especially at high token rates) while preserving per-delta speech output. Subscriber dispatch is serialized so a rapid stream tail (`message_update` → `message_end` → `agent_end`) cannot overtake the coalesced flush. ([#7443](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7443))
- Fixed translated MCP importers (Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, VS Code) silently dropping a server's `enabled: false` flag, so a server disabled at the source config stayed mounted; the flag is now propagated and honored like Codex, OpenCode, and native `mcp.json`. These importers now also load project entries before same-named user entries (matching native/Codex) so a project `enabled: false` suppresses a same-named user server ([#7652](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7652)).
- Removed the per-call `model` override from the eval `agent()` helper (all runtimes), completing the earlier task-tool removal (`9f8aa87dbf`). Subagents always use their selected agent's frontmatter model and settings; a legacy `model` argument is silently ignored, so an explicit `model: "default"` can no longer route children onto the parent session model ([#6438](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6438)).
- Fixed legacy Pi extension validation rejecting plugins such as `remote-pi` that import the package-root `convertToPng` image helper. ([#7610](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7610))
- Fixed the legacy session-directory migration silently deleting a live session's transcript when its filename collided with an existing entry in the destination: colliding entries are now preserved in place, the legacy directory is only removed when empty, and collisions/migration failures are logged ([#7593](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7593)).
- Fixed `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` being ignored when a system Chrome installation was detected, preventing Windows users from selecting a compatible headless browser for the shared browser daemon ([#7601](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7601)).
- Fixed `openai-models-list` discovery ignoring server-advertised input modalities, so custom virtual tier IDs absent from the bundled catalog showed `images: no` even when the `/v1/models` response reported `input: ["text","image"]` ([#7583](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7583)).
- Exposed exact source line counts in read results when selector-based reads reach EOF, allowing protocol bridges to distinguish a returned slice from the complete file ([#7590](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7590)).
- Fixed `grep`/`glob` silently collapsing a semicolon-delimited `path` list to one literal path when the joined string was too long for the OS to name (`ENAMETOOLONG`) — a list of bare filenames past `NAME_MAX` or absolute paths past `PATH_MAX` failed with `Path not found: <whole list>` even though every entry existed. The multipath probe now treats `ENAMETOOLONG` as a definitively non-existent single path so the split proceeds, and `glob` surfaces a clean `Path not found` instead of leaking the raw errno ([#7597](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7597)).
- Fixed `--mode json` (and text) print mode truncating a large final record (e.g. a multi-MB `agent_end`) when the process exited before stdout drained, while still exiting 0. Per-event writes are now serialized on their own completion callbacks and shutdown blocks on the last one, so the terminal record is delivered in full ([#7635](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7635)).
- Fixed text print mode treating buffered partial responses as replay-unsafe, allowing transient mid-stream connection failures to retry without exposing duplicated output ([#7625](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7625)).
- Fixed Hindsight `autoRecall` intermittently not reaching the model: two recall paths shared the `hasRecalledForFirstTurn` flag, and the `agent_start` event path could consume it first and inject only via an unawaited background prompt rebuild that a fast turn outran. `beforeAgentStartPrompt` (awaited before the turn builds) is now the sole injection path ([#7568](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7568)).
- Fixed `read memory://<id>` returning a confusing "Unknown memory namespace" error under `memory.backend=hindsight` (Hindsight stores memories server-side and has no `memory://` addressing); the handler now returns a corrective pointer to `recall`/`reflect` so a stray read — steered by the shared `recall` tool description — self-corrects in one turn ([#7587](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7587)).
- Fixed extension/custom/hook tool wrappers stripping schema methods off `parameters`: `applyToolProxy` bound every callable property, and binding a schema (a plain function carrying `toJsonSchema`/`assert`) dropped those properties, breaking wire-schema detection and crashing the status-line token estimator with `JSON.stringify(schema) === undefined`. Prototype methods are still bound; own data properties and schema callables now pass through untouched.
- Fixed bug where `agent()` calls in eval cells ignored turn cancellation and continued running indefinitely
- Fixed the built-in `tail` printing `tail: Broken pipe` and failing when a downstream pipeline reader exited early (e.g. `tail -c N file.jsonl | jq …` with jq aborting on a parse error); it now exits silently with 141 (128+SIGPIPE) like a real tail, in every output path including `--follow`.
- Fixed the in-process ps shell builtin rejecting common procps/BSD format specifiers (`ps -o tpgid,...` failed with `unknown output format specifier`); added `tpgid`, `pri`, `flags`, real/effective user and group columns, `wchan`, fault counters, `sz`, and the STAT `+` foreground flag.
- Fixed Herdr rejecting the macOS development launcher because its foreground process was reported as `bun` instead of `omp`.
- Completed usage-aware model fallback across startup, queued turns, same-turn tool continuations, ACP/TUI confirmation cancellation, eligible account reselection, cooldown restoration, and isolated subagent settings so low-usage handoffs remain lossless and cannot consume cancelled queued work.
- Fixed Agent Hub opening and selection becoming O(all rows) on large rosters: row rendering is now lazy around the selected viewport, and observer lookup is O(1) by id instead of copy-sorting every session per row.
- Fixed the bash interceptor blocking `grep`/`cat`/`find` used as a downstream pipeline stage (e.g. `printf 'x\n' | grep x`); a stage consuming piped stdin cannot be replaced by a path-based dedicated tool, so it is no longer matched, while standalone and first-stage searches stay intercepted ([#7496](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7496)).
- Fixed floating rejections from cmux browser guest JavaScript terminating the main process and every active session; attributable rejections now fail the browser run as tool errors while unrelated process rejections retain the fatal path ([#7365](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7365)).
- Fixed the Windows bash tool silently taking down the whole omp process when a command blocked until its timeout: cancelling a timed-out run walked the spawned child's descendant tree from raw `th32ParentProcessID` links, and a recycled pid matching the harness's stale recorded parent pid could enumerate omp as a false descendant and `TerminateProcess` it, killing the session with no `session_exit` record. Run-cancellation sweeps now refuse to signal the harness or any process collected beneath it, while still reaping the timed-out target when it owns a recycled ancestor pid ([#7452](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7452)).
- Fixed the unexpected-stop guard (`features.unexpectedStopDetection`) never firing for thinking-only stops: `isUnexpectedStopCandidate` only counted non-whitespace `text` blocks, so a `stopReason: "stop"` turn whose sole content was a signed `thinking` block (a trapped response or a truncated reasoning fragment from reasoning models) bypassed classification and silently ended the turn mid-task. Such stops are now candidates and are classified on their thinking text ([#7499](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7499)).
- Fixed Task cancellation hanging forever when a child ignored abort or stalled during cleanup ([#7483](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7483)).
- Fixed LSP diagnostics being dropped when servers normalize file URI percent-encoding or Windows path casing.
- Fixed WSL sessions missing Agent Skills stored in the Windows host profile's `.agents/skills` directory. ([#3779](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/3779))
- Fixed `omp setup python` to validate the same configured or discovered interpreter used by the Python eval runtime.
- Fixed self-update misclassifying glibc Linux hosts with an installed musl loader as musl hosts, which could download an unusable musl binary instead of the glibc release.
- Fixed a crash where opening the Agent Hub after a resume and moving the selection triggered an unbounded `ExtensionExitError` unhandled-rejection storm and exit 129. The postmortem module bound the native hard-exit at first evaluation; when the bundler deferred that evaluation into a `withHostGuard` window it froze the guard's throwing replacement, poisoning every later signal/fatal exit. The native exit is now resolved per call, and the guard stamps its replacement with the native primitive it shadows so mid-guard signals still exit ([#7393](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7393)).

## [17.2.8] - 2026-08-04

### Changed

- Upgraded the bundled omptype schema engine: intersection and pipe operators, bigint and RegExp literals in the string DSL, Standard Schema V1 interop, JSON Schema import via fromJsonSchema(), and richer union/collection error reporting.

## [17.2.7] - 2026-08-03

### Changed

- Replaced arktype with @oh-my-pi/omptype for tool parameter and config schemas, significantly improving startup performance with ~100x faster schema construction. Config schema errors are now reported via OmpErrors using the same path/problem structure.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where custom, extension, or hook tool wrappers stripped schema methods off parameters, causing wire-schema detection failures and status-line token estimator crashes.
- Fixed a bug where agent() calls in evaluation cells ignored turn cancellation and continued running indefinitely.
- Fixed the built-in tail command to exit silently with code 141 (SIGPIPE) instead of failing with a "Broken pipe" error when a downstream pipeline reader exits early.
- Fixed the in-process ps shell builtin to support common procps/BSD format specifiers, including tpgid, pri, flags, real/effective user/group columns, wchan, fault counters, sz, and the STAT + foreground flag.
- Fixed install.sh falsely reporting success on musl-based systems (such as Alpine Linux) when the binary fails to start; the installer now smoke-tests the binary, exits non-zero on failure, and provides remediation steps.
- Fixed Codex config.toml discovery incorrectly importing MCP servers that are configured with enabled = false.
- Fixed bash.patterns allow rules rejecting valid commands when quoted arguments contained shell metacharacters (such as Cargo benchmark regex filters).

## [17.2.6] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Added the `/reset` slash command to reset the conversation context in place: it drops the live messages, queued turns, and pending tool calls (and cancels the turn's async jobs, post-prompt continuations, and checkpoint/plan runtime state) while keeping the session id, title, cwd, model, and on-disk transcript. It records a durable reset boundary so the live transcript stays cleared across rebuilds (theme change, focus attach, `/shake`, resume) instead of resurrecting the pre-reset messages, while the full pre-reset history stays on disk ([#3580](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/3580)).

### Fixed

- Fixed extension slash commands appearing as user prompts after being handled locally.
- Preserved explicit session titles when branching from an earlier conversation turn.
- Fixed an issue where unhandled JavaScript rejections in the browser guest could crash the main process and active sessions, converting them into tool errors instead.
- Fixed a critical issue on Windows where cancelling a timed-out bash tool command could mistakenly terminate the main process due to PID recycling.
- Fixed an issue where supervised processes reaching a terminal state failed to notify their launching session, requiring polling; the broker now actively notifies the session upon process completion.
- Fixed crashes on macOS when using PCRE2-only grep patterns with Bun by defaulting to the interpreted PCRE2 engine instead of JIT, and introduced the `OMP_PCRE2_JIT` environment variable to manually control JIT compilation.
- Fixed issues with `/btw` branch promotion where branches could park behind active turns, cut from outdated session leaves, or leave rejected branch keys indistinguishable from composer input.
- Fixed database bloat by ensuring archived main and nested session rows are properly cleaned up from `stats.db` during garbage collection.
- Fixed startup hanging during local model discovery when a timed-out transport left its request pending, which blocked the CLI before OAuth login could finish ([#7482](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7482)).

## [17.2.5] - 2026-08-03

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced the computer tool's coordinate-batch schema with persistent JavaScript runs, and removed computer.backend and model-specific controller switching.
- Changed the edit tool's replace mode from a multi-edit batch schema to a single-edit schema ({ path, old_string, new_string, replace_all? }).

### Added

- Added a relay browser mode to drive local Chrome tabs via the OMP Browser Relay extension, supporting automatic daemon startup and tab grouping.
- Added a scriptable desktop session featuring window-targeted capture and input, native accessibility trees, clipboard access, and streamed screenshots.
- Added broker-shared language servers (controlled by the lsp.shared setting) to multiplex LSP servers across multiple instances in a project, reducing cold-start times and resource usage.
- Added optional timeoutMs to discovery configuration in provider options to configure custom HTTP probe timeouts for llama.cpp, Ollama, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- Added a cross-platform, in-process ps shell builtin with custom columns, sorting, and process metrics.
- Added the --service-tier flag to override the OpenAI service tier for a session.
- Added a configurable per-request web search timeout via providers.webSearchTimeoutSeconds.
- Added turn-aware /tree navigation shortcuts (Alt+Up/Alt+Down, Home/End, PageUp/PageDown) to traverse user and assistant turns.
- Added display.hideToolActivity and a Ctrl+Shift+O shortcut to toggle the visibility of model-initiated tool calls and results.

### Changed

- Exposed the script-driven computer schema to all models, including those with provider-native Computer Use support.
- Reduced omp --help cold-start latency and memory usage by rendering lightweight command metadata.

### Fixed

- Fixed durability of session transcripts to prevent data loss on process crashes.
- Fixed a bug on Windows where a timed-out bash command could terminate the main omp process.
- Fixed headless runs hanging or leaving background workers alive after completion.
- Fixed a crash when opening the Agent Hub after resuming a session.
- Fixed /mcp reauth environment variable expansion and token validation.
- Fixed fuzzy replace-all edits re-matching replacement text indefinitely, which could freeze the TUI.
- Fixed inspect_image ignoring configured thinking effort for vision models.
- Fixed compiled binaries dropping certain extensions with complex CommonJS/ESM dependency graphs.
- Fixed template argument substitution executing recursive placeholder expansion when positional arguments contain literal $@ or $ARGUMENTS tokens.
- Fixed project-scoped session directories using leading-hyphen names and collapsing distinct paths.
- Fixed manual /shake leaving the context budget anchored to stale pre-shake token counts.
- Fixed Mnemopi scoped recall reporting "No relevant memories found" when individual targets fail internally.
- Fixed skill:// resolution ignoring custom directories when a same-named skill exists in a default path.
- Fixed image paste failing on Wayland-only Linux sessions.
- Fixed prewalk switching to the fast model during read-only investigations.
- Fixed self-update misclassifying glibc Linux hosts with an installed musl loader as musl hosts.
- Fixed omp setup python to validate the correct interpreter used by the Python eval runtime.
- Fixed the terminal-tab title dropping to idle while an unsuppressed async job was still running.
- Fixed redirected stdin being ignored when Bun reports a pipe with an undefined isTTY.
- Fixed a literal API key configured via /login being hijacked on Windows by case-differing system environment variables.
- Fixed Esc during a streaming /loop iteration pausing the loop instead of aborting the current turn.
- Fixed heavily branched conversation trees shifting linear continuations into disconnected columns.
- Fixed plugin installation validation failures for legacy compatibility shims.
- Removed hard-coded references to disabled or absent agents in system and tool prompts.

## [17.2.4] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Added `requestIdFormat` (`"string"` | `"number"`, default `"number"`) to MCP server config, honored by the stdio, HTTP, and SSE transports. JSON-RPC 2.0 permits both id shapes, but Apple's `xcrun mcpbridge` decodes `id` as an integer only and silently drops string ids (`mcpbridge.DecodeError Code=1`), hanging every request until it times out. The option is OMP-specific, so set it in an OMP-owned config (`.omp/mcp.json`, `~/.omp/agent/mcp.json`, a project `mcp.json`/`.mcp.json`, or an OMP plugin); servers imported from another tool's config ignore it ([#7053](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7053)).
- Fixed Anthropic web search sending unsupported temperature parameters to sampling-restricted Claude models ([#7195](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/7195) by [@will-bogusz](https://github.com/will-bogusz)).
- Fixed mid-turn steering/peer-interrupt tool skips rendering as errors (red ✘, red border/text) in the TUI; pending and in-flight interrupt placeholders now render as neutral info cards while preserving whether `tool.execute` started ([#7199](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7199)).
- Added `Shift+Up` as a second default for the message dequeue, so the shortcut is reachable in macOS Terminal.app where Option is consumed for character composition.
- Added in-process `pgrep`, `pkill`, `pidwait`, and `top` shell builtins with cross-platform process discovery, BSD/procps-style filters, pidfile handling, signal selection, waiting, and snapshots.

### Changed

- Headless hosts (print/RPC/ACP/eval/SDK) now use a 1s SQLite `busy_timeout` for the session-critical databases (agent.db, history.db, stats.db), so lock contention no longer freezes the protocol loop for the full interactive 5s timeout; interactive hosts keep the 5s timeout. The interactive-host flag is now declared before settings load so the first database opens see the correct timeout.
- The model picker (`/switch`, alt+p) no longer blocks models whose context window is smaller than the live session: over-context rows stay grayed but selectable, and picking one compacts with the current model first, then switches. A cancelled or failed compaction keeps the current model.
- MCP JSON-RPC request ids now default to per-connection sequential integers instead of snowflake strings, matching the wider MCP ecosystem and making integer-only decoders like Apple's `xcrun mcpbridge` work without configuration; set `requestIdFormat: "string"` per server to restore collision-resistant string ids ([#7053](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7053)).
- `secret-placeholder.key` now resolves under XDG state (`$XDG_STATE_HOME/omp/secret-placeholder.key`) instead of the agent config directory, so it follows the same XDG layout as other state files.
- Daemon runtime directories (`run/daemons/<hash>`) and provider in-flight tracking (`run/provider-inflight`) now resolve under XDG state (`$XDG_STATE_HOME/omp/run/`) instead of the config root, keeping ephemeral runtime state out of `~/.config`.
- `marketplaces.json` now resolves under XDG data (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/omp/marketplaces.json`) instead of the config root, aligning with the XDG data category for user-scoped registry files.
- Existing XDG installs keep their placeholder key and marketplace registry: the legacy `~/.omp/agent/secret-placeholder.key` and `~/.omp/marketplaces.json` are copied to their XDG locations on first resolution.

### Fixed

- Fixed sessions without a granted `write` tool hiding discoverable and MCP tools behind the unusable `xd://` transport; those sessions now disable device mounting and expose the tools directly without gaining write access.
- Fixed collab guest prompts being sent to models as unframed developer context, so guest messages now retain their transcript attribution while reaching the model as prioritized user interjections ([#7288](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7288)).
- Fixed `/memory stats` and `/memory diagnose` showing "Memory stats is not available for the off backend" when memory is off, in both the TUI and ACP/RPC slash-command handlers; the off backend now says memory is off directly instead of naming itself as an unsupported backend ([#7251](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/7251) by [@KennethHoff](https://github.com/KennethHoff)).
- Fixed `/reload-plugins` retaining stale context-file contents and activation state in the current system prompt ([#7258](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7258)).
- Fixed compiled binaries failing to import nested wildcard export subpaths such as `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent/slash-commands/helpers/active-oauth-account`. Node matches `*` in an `exports` pattern across `/`, but the bundled registry enumerated only the top level and skipped any key containing a slash, so such an import resolved from source and died under bunfs — reproducible on the published 17.2.1 binary.
- Fixed concurrent session appends during `/move` recreating an orphaned `.jsonl` fragment in the old session directory ([#7270](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7270)).
- Fixed interactive launches hanging silently when a host project or its `.env` sets `NODE_ENV=test` or `BUN_ENV=test` ([#7261](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7261)).
- Fixed a subagent killed from the Agent Hub (`x`) reappearing as a `parked` row after closing and reopening the hub in a local session; the kill now leaves the ref registered as terminal `aborted` instead of unregistering it, so the persisted-subagent rescan no longer re-adopts the surviving transcript ([#7250](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7250)).
- Fixed manual and automatic Codex compaction dropping the configured OpenAI WebSocket preference ([#7198](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7198)).
- Fixed two remaining tool-card double renders: a superseded assistant turn no longer leaves its never-run cards above the re-run's fresh cards (a TTSR rewind retracts them immediately; an auto-retry removes the synthetic-settled failure cards when it supersedes the turn — while a genuinely terminal failure keeps its card visible), and a successful read whose persisted result wins a transcript-rebuild race no longer creates a fallback read group when its delayed live completion arrives ([#6879](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6879)).
- Fixed a tool card rendering twice when the provider rewrites a streamed tool call's id mid-stream — GitHub Copilot's `call_id|id` transport, or any stream that delivers the tool name/arguments before the id — so the block appears first with an empty or partial id and is populated in a later delta. The transcript keyed the live card by that mutable id, so the changed id spawned a second card: the old-id card orphaned as a blue pending preview while the new-id card took the result. Streamed tool cards are now re-keyed in place when their id changes, using the block's position in the streaming message as a stable identity ([#6879](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6879)).
- Withheld advisor nits and concerns while the primary turn is explicitly marked in progress, while still allowing blockers for unrecoverable active side effects.
- Preserved explicit `-e`/`--extension` and `--hook` packages under
  `--no-extensions` while excluding ambient extension factories and sibling
  capabilities from settings or installed OMP packages.
- Fixed explicit `thinking` metadata in `models.yml` custom definitions and `modelOverrides` being replaced by canonical catalog policy during model rebuilding. ([#7307](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7307))
- Fixed the auto-titler installing a model's whole answer as the session title when the tiny title model ignored the titling task and answered the first user message instead. `normalizeGeneratedTitle` now rejects overlong output (>80 chars or >12 words) so the caller defers titling to the next user turn rather than accepting a full sentence ([#7303](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7303)).
- Fixed the in-process `kill` builtin to validate signals, preserve negative PID operands, signal every process in pipeline jobs, continue after bad targets, and refuse non-probe signals aimed at the host process or process group.

## [17.2.3] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- Tightened the system prompt notation: the legend now defines `⟺`, `≠`, `∉`/`∌`, and operator binding order; replaced undefined symbols (`⊭`, `≢`) in prompt bodies; removed delegation guidance duplicated between the eager-tasks preamble and the delegation gates.

### Fixed

- Fixed headless browser launch storms and orphaned Chromium process trees: omp processes now attach to one project-shared Chromium owned by the daemon broker (tabs per session; Chrome dies with the last omp client in the project), concurrent browser opens in one process share a single launch, and concurrent daemon `start` requests for one name can no longer spawn duplicate untracked processes.
- Fixed Bash auto-background leaving a live `Bun.sleep` threshold timer scheduled after a command completes (or abort/steering wins) first, which could keep the event loop alive and delay SDK/headless shutdown until the threshold expired ([#7235](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7235)).
- Fixed ephemeral side turns and native compaction bypassing an explicit or fork-inherited prompt cache key ([#7218](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7218)).
- Fixed the live Ask dialog crashing the whole session with a `replaceTabs` TypeError when a question reached `AskDialogComponent` without a string `question` field; questions are now normalized at dialog entry, mirroring the transcript renderer ([#7211](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7211)).
- Fixed Codex web search collapsing backend errors to `Codex error (): Unknown error`; the SSE error parser now preserves the backend code and message from top-level, nested `error`, and `response.error` envelopes ([#7200](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7200)).

## [17.2.2] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Added an app.live.toggle keybinding (default Ctrl+L) to start or stop live voice mode.
- Added ctx.invokeTool(params, options?) to extension contexts, allowing wrappers to run native tools while inheriting context, abort signals, and progress updates.

### Changed

- Moved the display-reset default keybinding (app.display.reset) from Ctrl+L to Alt+L to accommodate the new live-mode toggle.
- Updated the hashline edit tool, streaming preview, and plan-mode guidance to support the unified PUT/CUT grammar, .= ranges, and named registers.
- Improved startup performance by moving subagent model-registry refresh and session-file opening off the launch critical path.
- Optimized session file writing performance by batching same-turn file-session appends.
- Rewrote the Codex saved-reset auto-redeem algorithm to be pool-wide, window-exact, and expiry-aware, ensuring banked resets are automatically and reliably redeemed across multi-account setups before they expire.

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash in Kitty terminals when rendering non-PNG tool-result images if PNG conversion fails.
- Fixed subagent evaluation resets (reset: true) wiping the shared kernel inherited from the parent session; resets from non-exclusive owners now fork into a private per-owner kernel.
- Fixed the copy selector and ask dialog rendering raw key IDs instead of human-readable keybinding labels.
- Fixed CLI positional initial messages bypassing automatic session-title generation.
- Fixed the environment-variable reference omitting Kitty Unicode placeholder controls and tmux placement caveats.
- Fixed extension validation failures during omp plugin install for extensions importing compact from @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent by adding the missing re-export.
- Fixed Bash interceptor rules to inspect unquoted/unescaped compound command fragments (e.g., &&, ||, ;, |, &, and newlines) instead of only matching the complete command input.
- Fixed ExtensionContext.cwd staying pinned to the initial session directory; it now dynamically tracks the active session's current working directory.
- Fixed the web-search provider picker description for xAI/Grok to clarify that it supports SuperGrok/X Premium+ OAuth sign-ins.
- Fixed /reload-plugins failing to reconnect MCP servers or refresh MCP tool and prompt-command registries.
- Enforced the centralized artifact spill threshold on oversized read results, persisting them as recoverable session artifacts.
- Fixed DuckDuckGo web search under-returning results above the first-page limit by automatically submitting continuation forms.
- Fixed DuckDuckGo web search ignoring after: and before: date bounds by correctly parsing and filtering result timestamps.
- Fixed env-driven OTLP trace export ignoring OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES.
- Fixed a fresh session with deferred MCP discovery injecting the newly mounted xd:// tool catalog twice into the first model request.
- Fixed the bash tool failing with EACCES permission errors on multi-user machines by scoping the snapshot directory per user ID.
- Fixed LSP write batching replaying stale whole-file snapshots over newer external changes made before the batch flushed.
- Fixed ctx.ui.editor() in ACP mode always resolving to undefined by routing it through the elicitation bridge.
- Fixed omp commit failing to resolve extension-provided models in both agentic and legacy pipelines.
- Fixed RPC hosts receiving no subagent lifecycle or progress frames when an IRC message revives an idle or parked keep-alive subagent.
- Fixed copied fenced-code body rows in assistant messages retaining component and container margins.
- Fixed mid-turn auto-compaction repeating dead-end rescue work and warnings at every tool boundary within a single oversized turn.
- Fixed automatic terminal appearance changes clearing native scrollback and snapping readers away from their current scroll position.
- Fixed exact-match edits failing on files containing credential-shaped tokens when secrets.enabled is active by using reversible placeholders instead of irreversible redactions.
- Fixed context usage collapsing to the latest response size for Cursor models that omit prompt-token usage.
- Fixed the browser tool crashing with EBUSY errors on Windows when a headless Chromium profile is locked during cleanup.
- Fixed the Python RPC client dropping context, compaction, OAuth URL, and terminal-settlement fields.
- Fixed the browser tool ignoring the url parameter when opening a new tab on an attached browser.
- Fixed browser automation disrupting attached browsers by adopting the active foreground tab and avoiding raising new tabs during screenshots.

## [17.2.1] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Added `--from-claude` and `--from-codex` session imports, also available from `/resume @claude` and `/resume @codex`.
- Added an opt-in OMP-native software-security workflow (`security.enabled`, default off) with immutable scan plans, exact-account Codex subscription affinity, native task-worker review, canonical findings/coverage/SARIF publication, project-scoped history, explicit dispositions, producer-differential comparison, and the read-only `security://` resource namespace. Generic SARIF and official Codex Security bundles normalize into the same OMP-owned store.
- Added explicit Codex Security cloud operations to the opt-in security workflow: list and start account-pinned cloud scans, inspect their progress, and import current findings into OMP's canonical store and `security://` namespace without changing the native scan engine or spoofing official runtime attribution.

### Changed

- Reserved `security://` from RPC host URI shadowing so vendor adapters cannot replace OMP's canonical security-analysis namespace.

### Fixed

- Fixed remote or LAN local-engine endpoints being ignored during model discovery: the llama.cpp and Ollama probes used timeouts tuned for loopback, so a host reached over the network could exceed them and return no models, while changing `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`/`OLLAMA_HOST` could keep reusing a fresh cache from the previous endpoint. Non-loopback hosts now get a generous discovery timeout, and Ollama cache rows are scoped to the normalized endpoint ([#7087](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7087)).
- Fixed `omp install` failing extension validation for pi extensions that import `createEditTool` or `createWriteTool` (e.g. gentle-pi) — the legacy `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent` shim exported the read/bash/grep/find/ls tool factories but omitted the edit and write ones, so a named import threw Bun's static "Export named X not found" error. Added `createEditTool`/`createEditToolDefinition` and `createWriteTool`/`createWriteToolDefinition` to match the upstream pi surface ([#7094](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7094)).
- Fixed Python eval's loopback tool bridge being routed through macOS system HTTP proxies, which caused `parallel()` tool reads to fail with `ConnectionRefusedError` after a local proxy stopped.

## [17.2.0] - 2026-07-30

### Breaking Changes

- Removed the `DEL`, `DEL.BLK`, `COPY`, and `COPY.BLK` hashline edit operations. Use `CUT` / `CUT.BLK` for deletion; removed content remains available to `PASTE`.

### Added

- Added server-name autocomplete for `/mcp` commands (`enable`, `disable`, `test`, `remove`, `reconnect`, `reauth`, `unauth`) using configured and runtime-discovered MCP servers.
- Added `CUT` and `PASTE` ops to the hashline edit tool for moving code without retyping it: `CUT N.=M` (and `.BLK` block forms) capture lines into a clipboard register, and `PASTE` operations insert them. The register flows across sections within a patch (cross-file moves) and persists across edit calls per session.
- Added `--from-claude` and `--from-codex` session imports (including compaction state for Codex), also available from `/resume @claude` and `/resume @codex`.
- Added interactive Exa API-key onboarding through `/login exa`, opening the official key dashboard and saving pasted keys for authenticated web search while preserving `EXA_API_KEY` and explicit-selection public MCP fallback behavior ([#1798](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1798)).
- Added `ExtensionContext.getAsyncJobSnapshot()` so extensions can read the owning session's async-job state without relying on process-global job-manager identity
- Added opt-in `tui.codexResetFireworks` celebrations for unscheduled Codex weekly usage resets and newly banked saved resets, shown in a theme-aware top-third modal until Escape ([#6858](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/6858) by [@joshrzemien](https://github.com/joshrzemien)).
- The Cursor exec bridge serves the seven modern Pi tool frames, mapping each to its local equivalent: `pi_read`/`pi_ls` → `read`, `pi_bash` → `bash`, `pi_edit` → `edit`, `pi_write` → `write`, `pi_grep` → `grep`, and `pi_find` → `glob`. The frames are a separate wire family from the legacy args, not aliases, so each mapping is a real translation — `pi_grep`'s `ignore_case` is the inverse of the local tool's case-sensitivity flag, `pi_find` searches filenames rather than contents, and `pi_edit`'s replacements are renamed to the local snake_case pairs.
- `providers.autoThinkingMaxEffort` (`xhigh` | `max`, default `xhigh`) raises the ceiling of the `auto` thinking classifier. `max` became a first-class effort tier after the classifier prompt was written, so `auto` could never reach it on models that expose the tier — only the `ultrathink` keyword could. Opting in adds `max` to the classifier's vocabulary, gated on the target model actually supporting it; the default keeps today's prompt byte-for-byte. The ceiling is enforced inside the effort clamp rather than on the classifier's answer, so a sparse ladder cannot snap an excluded request back up, and the Low floor is still resolved against the model's own ladder. The on-device 3-bucket classifier stays capped at `xhigh` regardless of the setting. The ceiling governs what `auto` resolves: a ladder with nothing underneath it yields no auto level, and a `thinking.requiresEffort` model still gets its lowest supported effort from the transport.

### Changed

- Improved grouped read-call layout by nesting each request's usage metrics beneath its final path.
- Improved turn recovery to prevent duplicate output streaming during credential rotation or model fallback when visible text has already been streamed.
- Optimized tool guidance for bash, grep, and glob to be more concise while clarifying shell boundaries and search timeouts.
- Optimized models configuration resource probing to run in a single child process, reducing startup contention.
- Startup release notes now default to a compact change-count summary. Use `startup.changelogMode` (`summary` | `expanded` | `hidden`) to control them; legacy `collapseChangelog` choices migrate automatically ([#6771](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6771)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic prompt-cache cold misses on session resume with multiple OAuth accounts: the account that served a session is now recorded in the session file (as a `credential_pin` sha-256 of the account + org/project scope, so exports carry no plaintext identity) and re-pinned on resume with the session's effective last-use time, so a fresh process no longer re-ranks accounts by usage headroom — which systematically routed away from the just-used account and cold-missed the entire account-scoped cache prefix. Sticky routing was previously stored only in the auth store's KV cache, which is in-memory when a remote auth broker is configured.
- Fixed Anthropic prompt-cache cold misses on session resume with multiple OAuth accounts: the account that served a session is now recorded in the session file (as a PII-free `credential_pin` hash) and re-pinned on resume, so a fresh process no longer re-ranks accounts by usage headroom — which systematically routed away from the just-used account and cold-missed the entire account-scoped cache prefix. Sticky routing was previously stored only in the auth store's KV cache, which is in-memory when a remote auth broker is configured.
- Fixed concurrent `createAgentSession` calls with the default agent id failing initialization with `Agent "Main" was replaced during session initialization` — each in-process embedder (e.g. the edit benchmark runner) can now pass a private registry via the newly exported `AgentRegistry`, keeping every top-level session's "Main" out of the process-global roster race.
- Fixed task tool blocks duplicating their per-agent progress rows into terminal scrollback on every update: live task frames now pin the transcript live region so mid-run rows are never recorded as frozen snapshots, and a detached background task freezes its progress the moment any of its rows commit to scrollback instead of mutating committed history.
- Fixed Codex reset fireworks comparing different quota tiers or plans, preventing false celebrations when usage reports switch between Spark and base weekly limits.
- Fixed Cursor ranged-read results losing the full file byte size after applying the requested window.
- Fixed empty Codex final-stop recovery discarding an earlier commentary message when both messages shared response metadata.
- Fixed Advisor availability with providers that refuse echoed reasoning by retrying once with primary thinking stripped and surfacing persistent refusals immediately.
- Fixed `/tan` agents being unable to read parent-session `local://` attachments by correctly resolving local protocol options against the parent session's artifacts.
- Fixed Codex web search silently returning plain completions when the hosted web search tool was skipped.
- Fixed TUI collaboration guest loader not starting when joining or reconnecting mid-turn.
- Fixed multi-second TUI freezes in reftable-format repositories by moving branch resolution off the render path and adding a timeout to synchronous git spawns.
- Fixed `xd://` device summaries containing control characters and exceeding size budgets by stripping control characters and bounding summaries by UTF-8 bytes.
- Fixed `task.softRequestBudget` configuration having no effect on bundled scout and sonic subagents.
- Fixed quick LSP server exits being misreported as reader failures and resolved an issue where explicit reloads were blocked by initialization backoff.
- Forced Git subprocesses to use the stable `C` locale to ensure predictable, non-interactive command output.
- Fixed compatibility replay issues for pre-upgrade launch brokers evaluating xterm inside the client process.
- Fixed Advisor cost tracking in the status line across conversation boundaries, ensuring session transitions, forks, and resumes correctly restore or isolate conversation spend.
- Fixed validation failures for legacy extensions importing from the package root, which previously blocked installations.
- Fixed ACP clients (such as Zed), TUI status lines, and collaboration guests not updating when model changes occur dynamically within the agent loop.
- Fixed assistant-facing resource summaries omitting parameterized MCP resource templates, ensuring failed reads list templates alongside concrete resources.
- Fixed redundant `xd://` mount notices and prompt-cache invalidation when resuming sessions or reconnecting devices.
- Fixed the model picker displaying placeholder model lists instead of the actual credential-aware catalog resolved at registration.
- Fixed file corruption and snapshot mismatches when writing files through the ACP client bridge by verifying the final on-disk content after client-side post-save formatting.
- Fixed `omp ttsr test` silently evaluating source files as prose when their extensions were missing from the allowlist, and expanded the allowlist to support .NET, Shell, SQL, Zig, Dart, Scala, Elixir, and Protobuf files.
- Fixed automatic light/dark theme switching in direct WezTerm sessions on macOS when DEC Mode 2031 is unsupported, and improved theme-change color responsiveness.
- Fixed configured `retry.maxDelayMs` not being forwarded into Anthropic retry handling, so over-budget server retry delays fail fast.
- Added tokens-per-second throughput to RPC `get_state` responses for non-TUI clients.
- Added the RPC `set_fast_mode` command and typed TypeScript/Python client methods for live fast-mode control.
- Added `fastModeEnabled` and `fastModeActive` to RPC `get_state` responses.
- Fixed RPC fast-mode state reporting after direct Anthropic rejects `speed: "fast"`, while allowing explicit re-enable requests to retry priority service.
- Added opt-in subagent access to `checkpoint`, `rewind`, `learn`, and `manage_skill` when explicitly listed in an agent definition's `tools:` frontmatter. Listing one of `checkpoint`/`rewind` auto-includes the other. Settings (`checkpoint.enabled`, `autolearn.enabled`) remain master toggles.
- Added a `browser.cdpUrl` setting that points browser automation at an already-running CDP endpoint by default, so `app.cdp_url` no longer has to be repeated on every call. Explicit `app` options still take precedence.
- Native compaction preserves provider-native success and non-authentication failure semantics while retaining authenticated cross-provider fallback when the native provider rejects credentials.
- Fixed the Cursor Pi exec bridge silently dropping frame arguments. `pi_read`'s `offset`/`limit` were ignored, so a ranged read returned the whole file; `pi_grep`'s `literal` was ignored, so a fixed-string search ran as a regex and matched the wrong lines; and the path/glob join produced a `./`-prefixed spec. Ranges are now composed onto `read`'s `:N+K` inline selector, literal patterns are escaped, and the join uses `node:path`. These are `optional int32` fields, so a present `0` is honored rather than folded into a default: `pi_read` with `limit: 0` answers with empty output instead of the entire file, and `pi_find` with `limit: 0` clamps to 1 the way the reference client does.
- `pi_grep`'s `context` and `limit` are honored. Neither is expressible in the model-facing `grep` schema — context width comes from `grep.contextBefore`/`grep.contextAfter` fixed at tool construction — so the bridge builds a per-call `grep` for frames that supply them. `GrepTool` accepts these as constructor options; the model-facing schema is unchanged, and a frame that supplies neither keeps the shared instance and the session's defaults.
- `pi_ls`'s `limit` is still not mapped, now deliberately: it caps directory *entries*, while the local `read` tool renders a depth-2 tree with per-directory caps and elision rows and applies a selector as a *rendered line* slice. Mapping it to `:1+K` would cap a different unit while appearing honored.
- The legacy pi shim's regex-literal escaper and path/glob join were verbatim copies of the modern bridge's. Both paths now call the shared helpers, so the two Pi translations cannot drift.
- Fixed every Cursor `pi_edit` frame failing instead of editing. Two independent causes: the session drops `edit` from the tool registry for Cursor so the model uses full-file `write`, but that registry is also the exec bridge's tool source, so the native frame — which the server sends regardless of the advertised catalog — found no tool; and the retained instance followed the session's configured edit mode, while `PiEditExecArgs` carries `old_text`/`new_text` pairs that only `replace` accepts (the default `hashline` takes a single `input` string). The bridge now resolves a `replace`-mode instance through its fallback resolver, still wrapped for approval.
- Fixed a `pi_grep` frame carrying `context` or `limit` escaping the approval gate. Honoring those fields needs a per-call `grep`, and the per-call instance was built raw while every registry tool is wrapped, so such calls bypassed `tools.approval.grep` and the exec-tier check for SSH-targeted paths. Both bridge callsites now build it through one shared factory that applies the same wrapper.
- Fixed Cursor advisors ignoring `pi_grep`'s `context` and `limit`. Only the primary session supplied the per-call `grep` factory, so advisor frames silently fell back to session defaults. Advisors now receive the same factory, gated on the advisor actually having been granted `grep`.
- Fixed Cursor advisors failing every `pi_edit`. The advisor roster handed the bridge the `edit` instance built for the advisor's own loop, which follows the configured `edit.mode` (`hashline` by default) and rejects the frame's `old_text`/`new_text` pairs — the same mode mismatch the primary bridge already fixed, on the path it missed. The exec map now substitutes a `replace`-mode instance, gated on the advisor actually having been granted `edit`, while the advisor's own loop keeps the tool it was given.
- Fixed `pi_bash` killing commands that explicitly asked for no deadline. `timeout` is `optional int32` and `bash` documents `0` as "disables the command deadline", but a truthiness check folded a supplied `0` into unset, applying the 300s default instead. A present `0` now passes through; negatives, which have no local meaning and would otherwise clamp to the 1s floor, still fall back to the default.
- Fixed the Cursor exec bridge granting `edit` and `grep` to sessions that withheld them. Both bridge-only tools are constructed rather than looked up, and `executeTool` prefers a constructed override over the registry, so a restricted tool set (`toolNames` without them, or `restrictToolNames`) still got a working `pi_edit`/`pi_grep` — native frames arrive regardless of the advertised catalog. Both are now gated on the session having actually granted the tool, matching the `delete` frame's existing check (issue #5680).
- Fixed Cursor advisor bridge tools bypassing approval settings. The advisor's `pi_edit`/`pi_grep` instances are approval-wrapped, but the wrapper reads `tools.approvalMode`, per-tool `tools.approval.<tool>` policies and `autoApprove` only from the execute-time tool context — which the advisor bridge never supplied, so every native advisor frame resolved as `yolo` with empty policies and ran past a configured `ask` or `deny`. Advisors now receive the same context store as the primary bridge.
- Fixed Cursor's `list_mcp_resources`/`read_mcp_resource` frames answering as though the client hosted no MCP servers. The bridge hardcoded an empty catalog and `not_found`, so resources from servers the session held live connections to were invisible to the model even while the same session read them through `mcp://`. Both frames now answer from the session's `MCPManager` — awaiting a server's background resource discovery rather than reading the not-yet-populated cache and reporting "advertises nothing" — and a lookup failure surfaces as an error rather than an empty catalog, which would read as "asked, none exist". A read carrying `download_path` writes the resource to that path and answers with the path alone, per the wire contract, instead of putting the payload back in the model's context. That path arrives from the server while the general-purpose resolver deliberately honors absolute paths and `..`, so downloads are confined to the workspace: the resolved target and its deepest existing ancestor must stay inside it, and a target that is itself a symlink is refused. The write then opens `O_NOFOLLOW` and refuses a non-regular or hard-linked file before truncating, so the final component cannot be swapped for a link or an inode shared outside after the check. A parent directory replaced by a symlink mid-write is still followed; closing that needs `openat`/dirfd walking, which this does not attempt.
- Fixed the Cursor native `delete` frame bypassing approval settings. Unlike every other frame it removes the file directly instead of running a registry tool, so no approval wrapper sat in front of it — the bridge's `allowDirectFileMutation` grant answers whether a mutating tool was granted, which is a different question from whether the user's policy allows the call. A configured `tools.approval.delete: deny`, or an `always-ask` session that this channel cannot prompt in, now refuses the frame and keeps the file.
- Fixed Cursor download-mode resource reads bypassing the session's mutation restrictions. A `read_mcp_resource` frame carrying `download_path` creates and overwrites workspace files without running a registry tool — the same hole the native `delete` frame had — so a session that withheld `write`/`edit`, or one whose `write` tier is `deny`/`always-ask`, still had files written. Both frames now share one grant (`allowDirectFileMutation`, renamed from `allowNativeDelete` now that it gates more than deletion) and one `write`-tier policy check, and the download refuses before the read so a blocked call does not fetch the resource either. The primary session derives that grant before it rewrites its registry: Cursor moves `edit` out of the tool map and `write` may be auto-registered later, so reading the map at bridge-construction time would have misjudged both.
- Fixed `pi_ls` never reporting that a listing was clipped. The bridge read the entry cap from a flat `details.resultLimitReached`, which `glob` sets but `read` — the tool serving `pi_ls` — does not: it records the cap through `OutputMeta` at `details.meta.limits.resultLimit.reached`. Every capped listing therefore reached Cursor with `entry_limit_reached` unset, reading as complete. Both shapes are now checked, the same way the truncation translation already handles its two producers.
- Fixed a mixed-content MCP resource read reaching Cursor mislabelled. The mime type was taken from the first content item while the payload came from whichever item supplied it, so an image blob followed by a text note sent the text as `image/png`. Each branch now reports the type of the part it actually sends.
- Fixed `pi_read`'s `offset`/`limit` returning more lines than the frame asked for. The range is composed onto the local `read` tool's inline selector, and a plain `:N+K` deliberately pads with one leading and three trailing context lines — helpful when a human reads a snippet, wrong for a caller that named an exact range: offset 5/limit 20 handed Cursor lines 4-27. Ranged Pi reads now compose `:raw:N+K`, which slices exactly the requested lines.
- Fixed `pi_grep` returning fewer matches than it asked for when they spread across many files. The local `grep` windows results to the first 20 files and tells the caller to paginate with `skip`, but `PiGrepExecArgs` has no `skip` field — so a frame asking for 100 matches over 25 one-match files got 20, `match_limit_reached` unset, and advice it could not act on: output silently short and labelled complete. A search carrying a total match cap now reads enough files to satisfy it (cap+1, so a result landing exactly on the cap is distinguishable from a clipped one) and reports the cap when it actually bites.
- Fixed every native `pi_edit` failing after a session switched onto Cursor. The replace-mode `edit` instance the frame needs was built only for sessions *created* on Cursor, and the tool roster is not rebuilt on a model switch — so a session that started elsewhere kept its configured-mode `edit` in the registry, which the bridge resolves before its fallback, and the frame's `old_text`/`new_text` pairs failed validation against a `hashline` schema. The instance is now built from the `edit` grant regardless of the session's initial provider (lazily, so a session that never reaches Cursor never constructs one) and `pi_edit` asks for it explicitly through a dedicated accessor. A session that was never granted `edit` is still refused.
- Fixed the Cursor bridge's tool resolver being able to execute an unadvertised `edit`. That resolver doubles as the agent loop's fallback for any call outside the advertised set, so serving `edit` from it meant a hallucinated call — or one naming a tool the session deselected after startup — could run a replace-mode edit the model was never offered. It is device-only again; `pi_edit` uses its own accessor.
- Fixed the legacy Cursor `read` frame ignoring the `offset`/`limit` modern builds paginate with. Only the Pi variant composed a range, so every page of a legacy read returned the whole file (or its own truncation) and a model walking a large file never advanced past the first window. Both frames now translate a range through the same helper, and the answer sets `range_applied` to describe whether a window was actually composed.
- Fixed the legacy Cursor `grep` frame ignoring its pagination `offset`. The local `grep` paginates by file through `skip` and advertises exactly that in its own "use skip=N" advice, so an unforwarded offset re-ran the identical search and answered page one for every page. The answer now reports the offset it applied in `offset_applied`.
- Fixed a paginated Cursor `read` or `grep` frame being recorded as an unpaginated one. The executed call and the transcript block are built separately, so forwarding the frame's range and page fixed only the execution: the block still showed a bare path and an unskipped search, which is what a reloaded session replays and what the next turn reasons from — a slice of a file presented as the whole thing, and results from a later window presented as page one. Both are now synthesized from the same translation that runs them, including a `limit: 0` read, which is recorded as the zero lines it returns rather than a whole-file read.
- Fixed Cursor advisors answering every MCP resource frame as though the client hosted no servers. Only the primary bridge received the `MCPManager`-backed resource adapter, so an advisor's `list_mcp_resources` reported an empty catalog and its `read_mcp_resource` a `not_found` even though the advisor shares the session's live connections. Advisors now receive the same adapter; it is not gated on a tool grant, since reading what a server advertises is a different permission from calling one of its tools.
- Fixed advisor tools bypassing the approval gate. They are built straight from the builtin table, outside the loop that wraps every registry tool, and both the advisor's own agent loop and its Cursor exec bridge (`pi_write`, `pi_bash`) run those instances directly — so an advisor granted `write` or `bash` executed them regardless of a configured `ask` or `deny`. They now carry the same `ExtensionToolWrapper` as every other tool.
- Added `mcp_notification` extension event and multi-listener `MCPManager.addNotificationListener` API. The runtime already received MCP server-initiated JSON-RPC notifications at the transport layer but had no path to forward them to extensions; every notification (including server-custom methods) is now delivered as `{ server, method, params }` after the manager's own list/update handling. For known list-change methods (`notifications/tools/list_changed`, `notifications/resources/list_changed`, `notifications/prompts/list_changed`) the internal refresh promise is awaited before fanout, so a listener acting on `tools/list_changed` sees fresh `getTools()`. Notifications received before any listener attaches are buffered (bounded FIFO, cap 100, drop-oldest — matches `IrcBus`'s `MAILBOX_CAP`) and drained into the first subscriber, so startup-time frames aren't lost even if the extension binds after MCP discovery. Extensions can use this to bridge push-capable MCP servers (e.g. peer messaging) into session behavior by injecting a mid-turn steer via `pi.sendMessage` / `pi.sendUserMessage`.

### Removed

- Removed the dangling `MCPManager.setOnNotification` single-slot setter, which had no callers in the runtime. Replaced by `MCPManager.addNotificationListener` — multi-listener, per-listener error isolation, returns an unsubscribe function.

## [17.1.8] - 2026-07-28

### Breaking Changes

- Changed tab.screenshot() to no longer accept a per-call save path; it now saves screenshots under browser.screenshotDir (or the OS temp directory if unset) and returns the saved path.

### Added

- Added omp cleanse, a new command that automatically detects language-ecosystem checkers, parses diagnostics (such as Cargo Clippy JSON), distributes repair workloads across concurrent subagents, and runs verification checks with a live progress bar.

### Changed

- Reworked the /guided-goal command from a modal-based popup flow into a natural, conversational chat interface where the agent asks follow-up questions directly in the session.
- Reduced startup memory usage by lazy-loading HTML session export assets only on their first use.

### Fixed

- Fixed Advisor notes appending stale-review-window warnings when newer primary turns are queued during a review.
- Fixed layout padding alignment issues in bordered output blocks and web-search result panels.
- Fixed excluded web search providers remaining visible in the Web Search Provider Order settings list.
- Fixed internal Hub peer messages being exposed as ordinary tool-call updates in clients like Paseo.
- Fixed compatibility issues when installing legacy pi extensions by updating the legacy shim to correctly bridge missing runtime symbols and exports (such as isContextOverflow, isRetryableAssistantError, and JSON parsing utilities).
- Fixed an issue where routine daemon operations (like list, logs, stop, or describe) could inadvertently trigger a restart loop for detached daemons in a backoff window.
- Fixed marketplace plugin MCP discovery to correctly honor the mcpServers manifest field in plugin configuration files.
- Fixed user-initiated shell executions (! and $) being misattributed as agent actions in advisor transcripts.
- Fixed unnecessary prompt-cache invalidations by preserving the active auto-thinking effort level when per-turn classification fails.
- Fixed the omp process name showing up as bun in Linux process managers (like ps and top).
- Fixed agent shell commands inheriting environment variables from the launch directory's .env file, ensuring they only receive the parent environment and explicit tool overrides.
- Fixed the /new command retaining completed or failed async jobs from the previous session.
- Improved error handling in omp update to display a friendly timeout message if the download times out while streaming the binary.
- Fixed the write tool incorrectly treating semicolon-joined read selectors as filesystem paths and creating unintended directory structures.
- Fixed omp worktree clear prematurely deleting active task-isolation sandboxes owned by running subagents.
- Fixed /vibe mode preventing the director from completing parent tasks after verifying worker results by keeping the built-in todo tool active.
- Fixed numeric GitHub issue and pull request autocomplete being suppressed inside skill slash-command arguments.

## [17.1.7] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Restoring a prompt with image attachments via esc-esc branch or `/tree` now re-attaches the images to the composer draft: previously only the text (with its `[Image #N]` markers) was restored, so resubmitting sent the literal marker with no image.
- Fixed large bash/eval/ssh output citing two different artifact ids in one result — the truncation notice said `Read artifact://N for full output` while the footer said `Artifact: N+1`. The streaming sink's head and tail windows each had a full budget, so a middle-elided inline body could reach `headBytes + spillThreshold` and always re-tripped the final-defense inline byte cap, which truncated a second time (two elision markers), saved a duplicate already-truncated artifact, and left the notice's line ranges stale. The head and tail windows now share the spill-threshold budget (head clamped to half), the cap budget derives from the configured threshold plus notice slack, and when the cap does fire on a sink-spilled result it references the existing raw artifact instead of saving a copy.

### Added

- Added the bundled `ts-no-local-is-record` TTSR rule, which catches local `isRecord` function and lambda definitions and directs agents to shared guards plus explicit shape validation.
- A `tool_call` handler (extension or hook) can now return `input` to revise the arguments a tool executes with, not just `block` it. The returned object is the raw execution input passed to the tool (ignored when `block` is set, and not applied to `computer` tool calls), enabling wrappers that normalize or rewrite a built-in's arguments without reimplementing the tool. For model-issued calls the event fires at arg-prep time in the agent loop, so a revision is revalidated against the tool schema and is what concurrency scheduling, `tool_execution_start`/transcripts, the persisted assistant message, and the approval gate all observe — the user approves exactly what runs, and a revision that changes a tool's functional concurrency (e.g. bash `pty`) schedules correctly. A revised nested `write xd://` device dispatch forfeits the outer write gate's approval and faces the full prompt again ([#6681](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/6681) by [@psyrendust](https://github.com/psyrendust)).
- Added a parser for macOS `sample`(1) call-tree reports to the read tool: `*.sample.txt` reads now return a compact bottleneck summary — per-thread hot paths with on-CPU sample counts (blocked syscall time excluded), demangled Rust v0/legacy symbols, flattened direct recursion, merged call-site siblings, idle-thread classification, and a process-wide top-functions-by-self-samples table. `:raw` still reads the original report, and files that merely carry the extension fall back to plain text.
- Added V8 `.cpuprofile` support to the read tool (Node/Bun `--cpu-prof`, Chrome DevTools, CDP `Profiler.stop` output): reads now return a compact bottleneck summary — hot-path call tree with on-CPU milliseconds (`(idle)` time excluded), collapsed pass-through chains, flattened direct recursion, shortened file URLs, and a top-functions-by-self-time table. `:raw` still reads the original JSON, and files that merely carry the extension fall back to plain text.

### Changed

- Direct and `xd://` dispatch now share one canonical tool map: `write xd://<tool>` executes any enabled top-level or mounted tool, and `read xd://<tool>` returns its docs, instead of failing when the name was exposed through the other layer. Mounted names are presentation metadata only, so tool replacement and disconnection cannot leave stale device instances; disabled tools remain unreachable, and both `xd://` and Cursor/top-level fallback execution retain the tool's approval and ACP permission gates.
- Session listing now caches parsed headers keyed on file stat identity (mtime + size), so repeated resume-picker opens and startup scans re-read only changed session files
- Reduced per-keystroke editor dispatch overhead: keybinding resolution happens once per input chunk and the per-action interception chain is gated behind a single canonical-key set probe
- `xd://` device docs now render the parameter schema as a comment-annotated TypeScript type (via `jsonSchemaToTypeScript`, the same renderer the in-band tool inventory uses) instead of a raw JSON Schema dump, shrinking system-prompt device sections while keeping descriptions inline.
- Added a `/vision [on|off|auto|status]` slash command for session-scoped control of the `inspect_image` vision-delegation tool, modeled on `/computer`: `on`/`off` force the tool for the current session only, `auto` returns to the persisted setting, and `status` reports the effective mode, session override, tool state, and active-model image capability.
- Replaced the `inspect_image.enabled` boolean with the tri-state `inspect_image.mode` (`auto`|`on`|`off`, default `auto`). In `auto` the tool is registered only when the active model lacks native image input, so vision-capable models (e.g. `kimi-code/k3`) read images inline with their own capabilities instead of delegating to a separate vision model; the tool set is re-evaluated on every model switch with a status notice when it flips. The `read` tool now follows the effective state dynamically rather than the raw setting, so it returns decoded image blocks again whenever `inspect_image` is hidden. Existing `inspect_image.enabled: true/false` configs migrate to `inspect_image.mode: on/off`.

## [17.1.6] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Added separate Advisor cost visibility to the status line, rendering primary and Advisor spend as `$2.67 (sub) + $0.41 (adv)` while keeping already-incurred Advisor cost across runtime disablement and same-session history rewrites.

### Changed

- Made the task tool's per-spawn `effort` parameter opt-in through `task.enableEffort`, which defaults to false and omits the field from flat and batch schemas and tool guidance until enabled.
- Reduced terminal-title update overhead by deduplicating unchanged titles on every platform and using `SetConsoleTitleW` through `bun:ffi` instead of OSC writes on Windows. Windows working titles now keep a static `:` separator instead of scheduling spinner updates; other platforms retain the animated separator.
- Added `task.maxEffort` to cap the task tool's optional per-spawn effort hint after model-specific resolution, so operators can enable effort hints without allowing them to exceed a configured ceiling; the ceiling now also rides into the spawned session so retry-fallback model swaps re-clamp to it instead of escalating past the cap ([#6580](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6580), [#6794](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/6794) by [@wolfiesch](https://github.com/wolfiesch)).
- Restructured the steering/interjection envelope sent to the model: the injected `<user_interjection>...<message>...</message>...` wrapper around user text is now a `<system-notice>` explaining the interjection followed by the user's raw message unwrapped, matching the existing `<system-notice>`/`<system-directive>` convention instead of nesting the literal message inside its own tag pair, which some models found confusing.

### Fixed

- Fixed a disabled higher-priority MCP server no longer disabling a same-named lower-priority one: disabled servers are now suppressed after key-level dedupe instead of dropped before it, so a project `foo` with `enabled: false` keeps the user-level `foo` off while still not starving a differently-named equivalent connection.
- Fixed the MCP tool-name collision winner flipping when the current owner reconnects: the winner is now chosen by a stable server+tool key instead of tool-array insertion order, which reconnects reorder.
- Fixed MCP resources with custom URI schemes being treated as missing filesystem paths. `read` and `omp read` now resolve server-advertised native resource URIs such as `ags://capabilities/current-host`, while preserving the existing `mcp://<resource-uri>` form.
- Fixed three gaps in native MCP resource URI resolution: server-advertised URIs whose path is exactly `/` (e.g. `catalog://root/`) are now preserved byte-for-byte instead of losing the trailing slash to reconstruction; opaque resource URIs (`urn:example:document`, `custom:item`) are recognized by the `read` and `omp read` resolver gates instead of falling through to filesystem handling; and a failing `resources/templates/list` no longer discards a successful `resources/list`, which previously produced a false missing-resource error.
- Fixed custom LSP servers sending `languageId: "plaintext"` for extensions outside the built-in language map by honoring an optional per-server `languageId` in `lsp.json` for disk and in-memory document opens ([#6800](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6800)).
- Fixed interactive extension confirmations ignoring `dialogOptions`, and cancelled handler-owned dialogs when the extension watchdog times out so stale approval UI cannot outlive a blocked tool call ([#6805](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6805)).
- Fixed the per-handler extension context snapshotting the live `ctx.model` getter, so a handler calling `pi.setModel()` and then reading `ctx.model` saw the stale model; the scoped context now delegates to the base context instead of spreading it.
- Fixed Python cell errors (`$` commands and the eval tool) leaking runner-internal traceback frames. Cell syntax errors now render as the bare caret display with a `<cell>` filename instead of a `_handle_request_async`/`ast.parse` stack dump, and runtime tracebacks start at user code, matching the Ruby runner's user-frame filtering.
- Dropped unavailable forced tool choices through the queue rejection lifecycle and discarded their remaining sequence yields so a skipped force cannot disable tools on the next request ([#6543](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/6543) by [@paralin](https://github.com/paralin)).
- Fixed identical MCP server connections discovered under direct and marketplace-plugin names spawning twice and duplicating mounted tool routes; distinct tools whose server names sanitize to the same route now keep the first registration and log both origins ([#6786](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6786)).
- Fixed `/usage` and the other large transcript command panels (`/session`, `/advisor status`, `/jobs`, `/changelog`, `/context`, `/memory view`) duplicating in native scrollback when invoked while an agent turn is streaming. These callsites mounted their finalized panel immediately via `present()` instead of deferring it until the turn ends via `presentCommandOutput()` (the path added in #5427 for `/tools`/`/mcp`), so the panel landed above a still-growing live block and was recommitted lower down ([#6767](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6767)).
- Fixed plan-mode task subagents unregistering extension-provided models, credentials, managers, and custom APIs from the shared parent `ModelRegistry` when restricted sessions intentionally skip extension loading ([#6783](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6783)).
- Fixed `/live` sideband WebSockets ignoring standard proxy environment variables and `NO_PROXY`, which left proxied sessions stuck while the rest of the Codex connection succeeded ([#6770](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6770)).
- Fixed the bash tool's `kill` builtin rejecting numeric signals and multiple process operands, stopping after the first failed target, and defaulting to `SIGKILL` instead of the standard `SIGTERM`. Negative PID operands (process groups per `kill(2)`) and the `--` end-of-options marker are now handled instead of being misparsed as signals ([#6779](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6779)).
- Fixed `learned.md` saves growing a blank line on every write (trailing-newline split artifact) and hoisting all headings/prose above all bullets, which re-scoped lessons under the wrong heading in hand-organized files. Saves are now byte-idempotent and preserve mixed Markdown ordering: non-list lines keep their positions, new lessons insert newest-first at the head of the first bullet run, and dedupe/cap operate on bullet lines in place.

## [17.1.5] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Added a configurable per-request timeout for the `inspect_image` tool (`inspect_image.timeoutMs`, default 5 minutes; set to 0 to disable) so a stalled vision-model provider fails fast with a clear error instead of blocking until manual abort ([#4165](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/4165)).

### Changed

- Reduced default startup resident memory by constructing the default-off ComputerTool ArkType schema only on first parameter access, then reusing it across tool instances without changing validation or tool behavior ([#6742](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/6742) by [@usr-bin-roygbiv](https://github.com/usr-bin-roygbiv)).
- Reduced startup CPU and memory by loading the bundled changelog only when needed, while preserving source, npm bundle, standalone binary, and native absolute-path fallback resolution.
- Moved PTY log replay into the shared project launch broker, so normal CLI and Hub startup no longer load the xterm runtime while launch logs return validated rendered terminal rows.
